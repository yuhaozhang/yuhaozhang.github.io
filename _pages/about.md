Hey there, welcome!

I am currently an NLP scientist at [Amazon AWS AI](https://www.amazon.science/), on a mission to deliver innovative and state-of-the-art AI/NLP services to enterprises and end users.

Before Amazon, I obtained my PhD degree from Stanford University, where I was jointly advised by [Prof. Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/) in the [Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu) and [Prof. Curtis Langlotz](https://curtlanglotz.com/) in the [Stanford AIMI Center](https://aimi.stanford.edu/). My PhD work has focused on natural language processing and its applications in medicine.

Before that, I obtained a M.S. degree in the Computer Science Department at <u>Stanford University</u>, and a bachelor's degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at <u>Tsinghua University</u>, China.
<br/><br/>

### research interest

I care about NLP systems and their impact in real-world applications. My research work has focused on four key areas:

- information extraction, with a focus on understanding entities and relations in both general newswire and biomedical text;
- text summarization, with a focus on improving the factual correctness of summarization systems;
- multimodal learning, with a focus on joint modeling of medical images and text;
- syntactic analysis and open-source NLP toolkit, and I am a co-author of the widely used [Stanza NLP library](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/).
