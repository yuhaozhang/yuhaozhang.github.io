Hey there, welcome!

I am currently a scientist in the founding team of [Samaya AI](https://samaya.ai/). We are on a journey to improve knowledge discovery by harnessing the power of large language models.

Before Samaya, I was a scientist at [Amazon AWS AI](https://www.amazon.science/) where I worked on core AWS services relevant to enterprise search.
I obtained my PhD degree from Stanford University, where I was jointly advised by [Prof. Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/) in the [Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu) and [Prof. Curtis Langlotz](https://curtlanglotz.com/) in the [Stanford AIMI Center](https://aimi.stanford.edu/). My PhD work has focused on natural language processing and its applications in medicine.

Before that, I obtained a M.S. degree in the Computer Science Department at <u>Stanford University</u>, and a bachelor's degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at <u>Tsinghua University</u>, China.
<br/><br/>

### research interest

I care about NLP systems and their impact in real-world applications. My work has covered the following areas:

- retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation;
- information extraction;
- summarization;
- multimodal learning;
- syntactic analysis and open-source NLP toolkit (I am a co-author of the widely used [Stanza NLP library](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/)).
